1. The **IoT Devices** such as *Rain Sensors* and *Temperature Sensors* will measure the relevant weather data like *humidity* and *temperature*
2. The raw data collected will then be transferred and stored in **IBM Cloud** which will be organised and preprocessed
3. The processed data will be passed into both the **Data Analytics** software for *Data Visualisation* and the **Machine Learning Model** for *prediction of future extreme weather events*
4. These results will then be fed into the **SCDF database** which can be accessed to better understand which periods of time will have the extreme weather events like *vegetation fires* and *flash floods* and they can be on standby to combat them
